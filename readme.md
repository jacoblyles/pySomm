Welcome to pySomm - a python utility for securely generating new wallets and addresses for the Sommelier blockchain

Warning: this program will generate sensitive data. If an attacker gets ahold of this data, you could lose your coins that are stored in these addresses. 

# Hardware Requirements

This program should be executed on an **airgapped** computer that is properly prepared. The airgapped computer will need to have Docker installed. 

1. Purchase a new laptop that has not been used for any other purpose
2. Physically remove the wifi card
3. Install a Linux distribution on the computer using a thumb drive

# Physical Security

When you use pySomm to generate a mnemonic seed, it will prompt you with the following safety checklist:

* Are you running this on a computer WITHOUT a network connection of any kind?
* Have the wireless cards in this computer been physically removed?
* Are you running on battery power?
* Is your screen hidden from view of windows, cameras, and other people?
* Are smartphones and all other nearby devices turned off and in a Faraday bag?
* Are you using casino-grade dice, or some other source of reliable entropy?

These steps are important to eliminate side channels that an attacker can use to steal your coins

## Room Shielding

Any operations involving your seed phrase should be conducted in a room shielded against electromagnetic radiation. If such a room cannot be procured on an immediate basis, a large box covered in aluminum foil should suffice.


# Installation

## For Testing

To install for local testing purposes on a non-airgapped machine, clone this repository and then run
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then you will be able to run commands such as 
```
$ python pysomm.py --help
```
Python 3.8 or higher is required


## Distributing to the airgapped machine

To install on the airgapped machine, you will first clone this repository on a preparation computer with internet access. The preparation machine should be a fresh machine, unused for any other purpose, with a Linux system installed with Docker. We will use this machine to create the **Docker Distribution Image**

To create the Docker Distribution Image, in the project directory run the following commands:

```
$ docker build -t pysomm .
$ docker save -o pysomm.tar pysomm
```
The `.tar` file can be copied to a thumb drive and taken to the airgapped computer. Once loaded onto the airgapped computer, it can be loaded using:

```
$ docker load -i pysomm.tar
```

Once the docker image is loaded onto the airgapped machines, all pySomm commands can be run with a  modification. Instead of running `$ python pysomm.py [command]`, use the following:

```
$ docker run --tty --interactive pysomm pysomm.py [command]
```


# Usage

## Generate a seed phrase

```
$ python pysomm.py --genseed [--entropy ENTROPY]
```

The `--entropy` flag is optional. If provided, the entropy must be at least 20 hex digits in length. You may use whatever high-quality source of entropy that you like, such as a hardware entropy source. 

If not provided, pySomm will ask that you use dice rolls to combine with system entropy. You should use [casino-grade dice](https://www.amazon.com/Trademark-Poker-Grade-Serialized-Casino/dp/B00157YFJE/) to ensure that the dice are unbiased and provide high-quality entropy.

Combining outside entropy with system entropy protects against attacks that compromise the system's random number generator. 

### Storing the seed phrase

Storing the seed phrase is a very sensitive operation. If anyone comes into possession of your seed phrase, they can steal your coins.
* **Never** enter your seedphrase into any computer other than the airgapped machine
* **Never** take a picture of your seedphrase
* **Never** allow any unauthorized person to see it

Once the seed phrase is produced by the program, write it down carefully and store it in an opaque envelope. This envelope should be stored in a secure, fireproof, waterproof location. 

For higher security storage, load a tool like [horcrux](https://gitlab.com/unit410/horcrux) onto the airgapped machine and split the seed phrase into shards that can be kept in separate, independent locations. 


## Generate addresses from the seed phrase

To generate addresses from the seed phrase, use the following command:

```
$ python pysomm.py --addresses "SEED PHRASE" [--idx NUM]
```

`--addresses` will return the first 5 addresses belonging to the wallet generated by the seed phrase

`--idx` is an optional flag that will return the `NUMth` address located at derivation path `m/44'/118'/0'/0/[NUM]` instead of the normal behavior

There is also another way to generate addresses that makes it easier to generate many addresses quickly: interactive mode. To access interactive mode, enter:

```
$ python pysomm.py --login
```
You will be prompted to enter your seed phrase. After that, you will be able to generate the next address, or a particular address very quickly.
